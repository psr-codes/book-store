            Vedas, Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and More India is the
            heartland of so many world religions. There is no area with such a
            wealth of spiritual wisdom, and you can enjoy all of the knowledge
            these sages have discovered through our Indian philosophy books and
            spiritual works. These teach us about the meaning of life, the real

            incomparable Vedas. The four Vedas are the foundation of Hindu

            looking for Indian religious books for sale, our selection is the
            best you will find. Mythological Books: The Mahabharata, the
            Ramayana, and More The mythology of India covers a great many
            cultures that have left behind massive literature. Our mythological
            books impart stories that teach us about the nature of the gods
            themselves, but they also teach us about our own ways of being. And
            when we read mythology, we take in stories that have been passed
            down since time immemorial, bringing us close to people who lived in
            ancient times. No book collection is complete without the epics of
            the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. These are the basis of
            storytelling in India, and they have been enjoyed by people since
            the earliest days of writing. We also have books that tell regional
            folk tales. This includes stories from all the many cultures that
            make India what it is today. These stories teach us life lessons,
            and they also teach us about the people who created them. Books on
            Science: Ayurveda, Astrology, Yoga, and More Ancient India was one
            of the most scientifically advanced cultures of its time. That deep
            history of learning has continued to this present day, with ever
            more searching and ever more study developing these sciences into
            the forefront of human knowledge. Many of these schools bridge the
            gap between the material world and the spiritual world — some of the
            only sciences that do this in the entire world. Our astrology books
            teach about the Indian school of astrology, which has influenced the
            world’s understanding of the stars and their impact on our lives. We
            also have works on Ayurveda, the study of how to bring balance to
            our body and soul to improve our wellbeing. You can also find works
            on yoga, an artform that promises to bring us to enlightenment.
            These vital sciences are as relevant today as ever before. If we
            continue to learn what they have to teach us, we will be well suited
            to take on the challenges of the future. Buddhist Books: The
            Dhammapada, Histories of Buddhism, and More Exotic India has an
            amazing selection of Indian books on Buddhism. These impart the
            divine teachings of the Buddha, who laid out a pathway to escape
            suffering and the cycle of rebirth. Buddha’s words have taught
            people how to live for thousands of years, and they are still
            guiding people to the right path. Our collection traces the
            tradition from the Buddha himself, all the way to present-day
            writings on living as a Buddhist in modern times. These include
            philosophical writings as well as histories. With these, you can
            learn about this powerful religion and begin or continue your own
            spiritual journey. Cultural Books: Dance, Music, Architecture, Art,
            and More Our Indian books on culture teach you about the legacy of
            the arts on the subcontinent, as well as all the amazing creations
            going on today. It’s the best education you can receive in Indian
            culture, all just a few clicks away. India’s culture has thrived for
            so long because it is home to so many different peoples. Through
            cultural exchange, these groups have quickly developed a tremendous
            amount of art. That wealth of creation fascinates and entertains
            people around the world because it is able to express something
            universally human, yet passionately embraces the cultures from which
            it came. Our cultural books cover India’s amazing diversity of
            artistic forms, like dance, music, visual arts, architecture, and
            many more. FAQs Q1. What is the purpose of a religious book? The
            very purpose of a religious book is to describe the relationship
            between a soul (Jivatma) and God (Paramatma), and how to establish
            that relationship. This spiritual knowledge helps one to transcend
            the three modes of material nature (Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas) and be
            freed from the pangs of threefold miseries (Adi-Daivik, Adi-Bhautik,
            and Adi-Adhyatmik Klesh). It is believed that those who read and
            understand the subject matter of a religious book every day, remain
            in the light of knowledge and are not bewildered even by slight
            changes and difficulties in life. Q2. What is called a religious
            book? A religious book, as the name suggests, is any book that talks
            about religion (Dharma). Religion refers to the constitutional
            position or nature of the living entities. Thus, a religious book
            describes what is the identity of an individual, their relationship
            with God, and how to build it. It may sometimes also mention God’s
            names, paraphernalia, pastimes, and characteristics. This knowledge
            is called the Absolute Truth because it describes the source of
            everything (God) from which everything is emanated. Q3. What are the
            books of God called? Books of God are called scriptures that talk
            about the science of God, and elaborately explain how to achieve the
            love of Godhead. The Scriptures deal with all aspects of knowledge,
            both material and spiritual. They may also mention the qualities of
            God, His names, paraphernalia, activities, and pastimes. This
            knowledge sets one free from material perplexities and elevates his
            consciousness to a higher platform (spiritual platform) after which,
            he is not affected by the pangs of material existence.
